Mp3Play, by Carlos Lint <carlos.lint@gmail.com>

Mp3Play is a short program made to play ordinary .mp3 files over ALSA (and
Pulse wherever there's Pulse output under Alsa).

All the alsa-related initialization was based off of libalsa's example as
far as the author can remember.

The mp3 is decoded by mpglib, which is mpg123's backend.

This is a simple program to show how can you decode mp3 in Linux using C.
